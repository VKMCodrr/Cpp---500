🧠 500 C++ Programs to Master Programming (Beginner to Advanced)

Welcome to “500 C++ Programs to Master Programming” — a comprehensive, structured, and beginner-friendly repository designed to help you build a rock-solid foundation in C++ while progressing toward advanced problem-solving and computer science concepts.

🚀 Overview

This repository contains 500 carefully categorized and tiered C++ problems, ranging from simple control-flow exercises to complex algorithmic implementations.
Each problem is crafted to develop logic, deepen understanding, and improve coding fluency in C++ through hands-on practice.

You’ll move from:
🧩 Foundational concepts (loops, conditions, variables)
💡 Intermediate challenges (arrays, strings, pointers)
⚙️ Advanced logic & algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion, data structures)

🗂️ Module Structure

The problems are organized into modules, each focusing on a key C++ or computer science concept:

No.	Module	Description
1	Control Flow & Logic	Master conditional statements, loops, and decision-making.
2	Loops & Iteration	Build efficiency and control through iterative problem solving.
3	Patterns	Print creative and mathematical star/number/alphabet patterns.
4	Arrays	Learn storage, traversal, manipulation, and optimization.
5	Strings	Strengthen character-level operations and text manipulation.
6	Pointers & Memory	Gain in-depth understanding of pointers, memory, and data references.
7	Sorting	Implement sorting algorithms from Bubble Sort to QuickSort and beyond.
8	Searching	Explore efficient searching algorithms and optimizations.
...	(More modules coming soon)	Data Structures, Recursion, OOP, File Handling, and more!

Each module is further divided into tiers:

🟢 Foundation — Beginner-friendly problems to learn syntax and logic.

🟡 Intermediate — Logic-building challenges using multiple concepts.

🔴 Advanced — Real-world logic, algorithmic thinking, and optimization.
